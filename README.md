## Hey, I'm Alex 👋

I am building [vula](https://www.vula.vc) to empower a continent to be the future of us all. 

I quit my job in May 2021  to make products I believe should exist. Since then I have built 30 products, 2 turned to businesses and 1 (vula) has been venture backed.

## What I am proud of:

- 🌍 [vula](https://www.vula.vc) - A platform for African startups and SMEs to navigate, apply and get financing. [OpenAI, Typescript, Node, Python, Prisma]
