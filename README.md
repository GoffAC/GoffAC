## Hey, I'm Alex 👋

⬅️⬅️⬅️ yes that is me in a race car - one that I made in Uni!

I quit my job in May to make products I believe should exist.

I am always interested to work on interesting projects - please [message me on twitter](www.twitter.com/AlexCharlesGoff)

## I am working on:

- 🌳 [treemeals.co](www.treemeals.co) - A carbon counting food diary (did you know orange juice is worse than bacon?!)

- 🏡 [compairbnb.info](www.compairbnb.info/hello) - the easiest way to narrow down which airbnb you want to stay in

- ⏳ [everyhour.xyz](www.everyhour.xyz) - My way of staying productive - by tracking my life balance.
