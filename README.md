## Hey, I'm Alex 👋

I quit my job in may to make project I believe should exist. Always interested to work on interesting projects - please [message me on twitter](www.twitter.com/AlexCharlesGoff)

## I am working on:

- 🌳 [treemeals.co](www.treemeals.co) - A carbon counting food diary (did you know orange juice is worse than bacon?!)

- 🏡 [compairbnb.info](www.compairbnb.info/hello) - the easiest way to narrow down which airbnb you want to stay in
