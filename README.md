### Hey, I'm Alex 👋

I quit my job in may to make project I believe should exist. 

- 🌳 [www.treemeals.co](treemeals.co) - A carbon counting food diary (did you know orange juice is worse than bacon?!)

- 🏡 [www.compairbnb.info/hello](compairbnb.info) - the easiest way to narrow down which airbnb you want to stay in

- ⏳ [www.everyhour.xyz](everyhour.xyz) - My way of staying productive - by tracking my life balance.
